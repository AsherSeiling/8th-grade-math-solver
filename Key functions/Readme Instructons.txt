When you start a new funtion start in in a different file and copy the contents of the python file in the folder. 
When you finish making a function the last line should be 'ynrspble()' 
to redirect to the functon that asks you to go back to the main menue. To intergrate into the main branch copy the code into 
'Seiling math solver.py' and then in the line above the functon type its functon with a '#'
then go to the function 'problemlist():'
and add the name and number of the function to the menu and add a 'elif' statement to make the functon selectable.
If your calculaton involves PI use a variable 'pi' which should be equal to 3.1415
